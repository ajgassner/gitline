gitline - a git history to html renderer implemented in javascript.

Idea is to have this on a central server or your local machine, to keep tabs on what your team is doing :)
needs a json file as input (generated with git2json)

Tries to autodetect the category and assignment of branches and groups commits accordingly.

Future developments will include:
- show author and timestamp metadata
- filtering functionality (by branches, author etc.)
- support other input formats like github-api
- statistics
